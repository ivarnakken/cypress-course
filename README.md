# A course I had on Cypress with Itera

The tasks are located in [__tasks__](https://github.com/ivarnakken/cypress-course/tree/main/__tasks__). My solutions to the tasks are written in [cypress/integration/tasks](https://github.com/ivarnakken/cypress-course/tree/main/cypress/integration/tasks).

Open the Cypress test runner by typing the following in the terminal
```bash
$ yarn cypress open
